This file is used by DevForce to indicate the presence of a CodeFirst model in this project.

During project build, the presence of this file in the project indicates that DevForce
should generate or update the model metadata file (*.ibmmx) for the CodeFirst model.

If you delete this file, the model metadata file (*.ibmmx) will not be generated, or updated
if already present.  To ensure that the model metadata file and your CodeFirst entities
stay in synch, keep this file in your project.

The file is not used at runtime, and does not need to be deployed.
