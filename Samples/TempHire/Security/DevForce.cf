This file is used by DevForce to indicate the presence of a Code First model in this project.

During project build, the presence of this file in the project indicates that DevForce
should (re)generate the model metadata file (*.ibmmx) for the Code First model.

If you delete this file, the model metadata file (*.ibmmx) will not be (re)generated.
To ensure that the model metadata file and your Code First entities stay in synch, 
keep this file in your project.

The file is not used at runtime, and does not need to be deployed.
